Challenge 1 – Cat management (Laravel - PHP o React)
Jack owns so many cats that he can’t keep track of all of them. He needs some way to keep track of all of his cats - almost like a Pokédex for cats. Your app should be able to complete the following tasks:

Add a new Cat (Name, Breed, Description, or anything else you think would be important)
Remove Cats
Edit Cats
List all of his Cats
Map screen showing the location of each cat
Persist data 
Build the Back End using Node or any backend language of your preference
Build the Front End using the Frontend tech stack that you’re comfortable with
 

Challenge 2 - Orange Shop (Python)

You own an orange store, you want to have “n” number of containers with “m” amount of oranges that can hold. It must allow the sale of oranges (you define the price per orange) and check the shelves after each sale. The oranges that are sold must be in order, for example, there are 3 shelves, the shelf most to the right is the one that always has priority, and the oranges to the left of this, move to the nearest right to avoid let them get bad at a certain point, you should be able to sell apples, applying the same rules as above. if a shelf of oranges is empty, and there are no oranges left, it'll be filled with apples
Your solution should allow, only to define the number containers, the amount per container and the price per orange. You can simulate the sells, or allow an input to sell oranges and apples
